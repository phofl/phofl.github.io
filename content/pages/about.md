Hi, I am Patrick Hoefler. I am a core contributor to pandas, and I am currently
working at [Coiled](https://www.coiled.io). I focus on the development of 
[Dask](https://github.com/dask/dask).

I have a Masters's degree in Mathematics from the Julius-Maximilians-Universit√§t in Wuerzburg. I
am currently studying towards a Master of Science degree in Software Engineering at the University
of Oxford.

As a core developer of pandas I am mostly working on several of our Roadmap items like
improving the support of our extension array dtypes. Additionally, I am doing Sprints with 
[PyLadies Berlin](https://berlin.pyladies.com) aimed at attracting new contributors for pandas.

The postings on this site are my own and do not necessarily represent the position, strategy or 
opinions of Coiled.
