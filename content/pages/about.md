Hi, I am Patrick Hoefler. I am a core contributor to pandas, and I am currently
working at [d-fine](https://www.d-fine.com/en/). I mostly develop individual software components
for clients in the insurance industry using the PyData software stack. 

I have a Masters's degree in Mathematics from the Julius-Maximilians-Universit√§t in Wuerzburg. I
am currently studying towards a Master of Science degree in Software Engineering at the University
of Oxford.

As a core developer of pandas I am mostly working on several of our Roadmap items like
improving the support of our extension array dtypes. Additionally, I am doing Sprints with 
[PyLadies Berlin](https://berlin.pyladies.com) aimed at attracting new contributors for pandas.
