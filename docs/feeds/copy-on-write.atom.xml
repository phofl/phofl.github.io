&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/gitconnected/welcoming-pandas-2-0-194094e4275b"&gt;pandas 2.0&lt;/a&gt; was released in 
early April and brought many improvements to the new Copy-on-Write (CoW)
mode. The feature is expected to become the default in pandas 3.0, which is scheduled for
April 2024 at the moment. There are no plans for a legacy or non-CoW mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series of posts will explain how Copy-on-Write works internally to help users understand what's 
going on, show how to use it effectively and illustrate how to adapt your code. This will include 
examples on how to leverage the mechanism to get the most efficient performance and also show a 
couple of anti-patterns that will result in unnecessary bottlenecks. I wrote a 
&lt;a href="https://medium.com/towards-data-science/a-solution-for-inconsistencies-in-indexing-operations-in-pandas-b76e10719744"&gt;short introduction&lt;/a&gt;
to Copy-on-Write a couple of months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote &lt;a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/pandas-internals-explained-545f14a941c1"&gt;a short post&lt;/a&gt; 
that explains the data structure of pandas which will help understand some terminology that is 
necessary for CoW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am part of the pandas core team and was heavily involved in implementing and improving CoW so far. 
I am an open source engineer for &lt;a href="https://www.coiled.io"&gt;Coiled&lt;/a&gt; where I work on Dask, 
including improving the pandas integration and ensuring that Dask is compliant with CoW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="how-copy-on-write-changes-pandas-behavior"&gt;How Copy-on-Write changes pandas behavior&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of you are probably familiar with the following caveats in pandas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-python"&gt;import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({&amp;quot;student_id&amp;quot;: [1, 2, 3], &amp;quot;grade&amp;quot;: [&amp;quot;A&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;C&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;D&amp;quot;]})
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's select the grade-column and overwrite the first row with &lt;code&gt;"E"&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-python"&gt;grades = df[&amp;quot;grade&amp;quot;]
grades.iloc[0] = &amp;quot;E&amp;quot;
df

   student_id grade
0           1     E
1           2     C
2           3     D
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this also updated &lt;code&gt;df&lt;/code&gt; and not only &lt;code&gt;grades&lt;/code&gt;, which has the potential to 
introduce hard to find bugs. CoW will disallow this behavior and ensures that only &lt;code&gt;df&lt;/code&gt; is
updated. We also see a false-positive &lt;code&gt;SettingWithCopyWarning&lt;/code&gt; that doesn't help us here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look at a &lt;code&gt;ChainedIndexing&lt;/code&gt; example that is not doing anything:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-python"&gt;df[df[&amp;quot;student_id&amp;quot;] &amp;gt; 2][&amp;quot;grades&amp;quot;] = &amp;quot;F&amp;quot;
df

   student_id grade
0           1     A
1           2     C
2           3     D
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We again get a &lt;code&gt;SettingWithCopyWarning&lt;/code&gt; but nothing happens to &lt;code&gt;df&lt;/code&gt; in this example. All these
gotchas come down to copy and view rules in NumPy, which is what pandas uses under the hood. pandas
users have to be aware of these rules and how they apply to pandas DataFrames to understand why
similar code patterns produce different results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CoW cleans up all these inconsistencies&lt;/strong&gt;. Users can only update one object at a time when CoW is
enabled, e.g. &lt;code&gt;df&lt;/code&gt; would be unchanged in our first example since only &lt;code&gt;grades&lt;/code&gt; is updated at
that time and the second example raises a &lt;code&gt;ChainedAssignmentError&lt;/code&gt; instead of doing nothing.
Generally, it won't be possible to update two objects at once, e.g., every object behaves as it
is a copy of the previous object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many more of these cases, but going through all of them is not in scope here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="how-it-works"&gt;How it works&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look into Copy-on-Write in more detail and highlight some facts that are good to know. This is 
the main part of this post and is fairly technical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copy-on-Write promises that &lt;strong&gt;any DataFrame or Series derived from another in&lt;/strong&gt; 
&lt;strong&gt;any way always behaves as a copy&lt;/strong&gt;. This means that it is not possible to modify more than one
object with a single operation, e.g. our first example above would only modify &lt;code&gt;grades&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very defensive approach to guarantee this would be to copy the DataFrame and its data in every 
operation, which would avoid views in pandas altogether. This would guarantee CoW semantics but 
also incur a huge performance penalty, so this wasn't a viable option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will now dive into the mechanism that ensures that no two objects are updated with a single
operation &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; that our data isn't unnecessarily copied. The second part is what makes the
implementation interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to know exactly when to trigger a copy to avoid copies that aren't absolutely necessary.
Potential copies are only necessary if we try to mutate the values of one pandas object without
copying it's data. We have to
trigger a copy, if the data of this object is shared with another pandas object.
This means that we have to keep track of whether one NumPy array is referenced by two DataFrames (generally, we have to be
aware if one NumPy array is referenced by two pandas objects, but I will use the term DataFrame for 
simplicity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-python"&gt;df = pd.DataFrame({&amp;quot;student_id&amp;quot;: [1, 2, 3], &amp;quot;grade&amp;quot;: [1, 2, 3]})
df2 = df[:]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This statement creates a DataFrame &lt;code&gt;df&lt;/code&gt; and a view of this DataFrame &lt;code&gt;df2&lt;/code&gt;. View means that
both DataFrames are backed by the same underlying NumPy array. When we look at this with CoW, 
&lt;code&gt;df&lt;/code&gt; has to be aware that &lt;code&gt;df2&lt;/code&gt; references its NumPy array too. This is not sufficient 
though. &lt;code&gt;df2&lt;/code&gt; also has to be aware that &lt;code&gt;df&lt;/code&gt; references its NumPy array. If both objects
are aware that there is another DataFrame referencing the same NumPy array, we can trigger a copy
in case one of them is modified, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-python"&gt;df.iloc[0, 0] = 100
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;df&lt;/code&gt; is modified inplace here. &lt;code&gt;df&lt;/code&gt; knows that there is another object that references the same data, 
e.g. it triggers a copy. It is not aware which object references the same data, just that there is
another object out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at how we can achieve this. We created an internal class &lt;code&gt;BlockValuesRefs&lt;/code&gt; that
is used to store this information, it points to all DataFrames that reference a given NumPy array. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three different types of operation that can create a DataFrame:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A DataFrame is created from external data, e.g. through &lt;code&gt;pd.DataFrame(...)&lt;/code&gt; or through any
  I/O method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new DataFrame is created through a pandas operation that triggers a copy of the original data,
  e.g. &lt;code&gt;dropna&lt;/code&gt; creates a copy in almost all cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new DataFrames is created through a pandas operation that &lt;strong&gt;does not&lt;/strong&gt; trigger a copy of the
  original data, e.g. &lt;code&gt;df2 = df.reset_index()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two cases are simple. When the DataFrame is created, the NumPy arrays that back it are
connected to a fresh &lt;code&gt;BlockValuesRefs&lt;/code&gt; object. These arrays are only referenced by the new
object, so we don't have to keep track of any other objects. The object creates a &lt;code&gt;weakref&lt;/code&gt; that points
to the &lt;code&gt;Block&lt;/code&gt; that wraps the NumPy array and stores this reference internally. The concept
of Blocks is explained &lt;a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/pandas-internals-explained-545f14a941c1"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/weakref.html"&gt;weakref&lt;/a&gt; creates a reference to any Python
object. It does not keep this object alive when it would normally go out of scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;```python
import weakref&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;class Dummy:
    def &lt;strong&gt;init&lt;/strong&gt;(self, a):
        self.a = a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In[1]: obj = Dummy(1)
In[2]: ref = weakref.ref(obj)
In[3]: ref()
Out[3]: &amp;lt;&lt;strong&gt;main&lt;/strong&gt;.Dummy object at 0x108187d60&amp;gt;
In[4]: obj = Dummy(2)
```&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This example creates a Dummy object and a weak reference to this object. Afterward, we assign another
object to the same variable, e.g. the initial object goes out of scope and is garbage collected. The weak reference
does not interfere with this process. If you resolve the weak reference, it will point to &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;
instead of the original object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;python
In[5]: ref()
Out[5]: None&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ensures that we don't keep any arrays alive that would otherwise be garbage collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at how these objects are organized:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="../images/deep_dive_cow/copy-on-write.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our example has two columns &lt;code&gt;"a"&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;"b"&lt;/code&gt; which both have dtype &lt;code&gt;"int64"&lt;/code&gt;. They are backed
by one Block that holds the data for both columns. The Block holds a hard reference to the reference
tracking object, ensuring that it stays alive as long as the Block is not garbage collected. The
reference tracking object holds a weak reference to the Block. This enables the object to track
the lifecycle of this block but does not prevent garbage collection. The reference tracking object
does not hold a weak reference to any other Block yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the easy scenarios. We know that no other pandas object shares the same NumPy array, so we can
simply instantiate a new reference tracking object. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third case is more complicated. The new object views the same data as the original object.
This means that both objects point to the same memory. Our operation will create a new Block that
references the same NumPy array, this is called a shallow copy. We now have to register this new 
&lt;code&gt;Block&lt;/code&gt; in our reference tracking mechanism. We will register our new &lt;code&gt;Block&lt;/code&gt; with the reference 
tracking object that is connected to the old object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-python"&gt;df2 = df.reset_index(drop=True)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="../images/deep_dive_cow/copy-on-write_view.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;code&gt;BlockValuesRefs&lt;/code&gt; now points to the Block that backs the initial &lt;code&gt;df&lt;/code&gt; and the newly created
Block that backs &lt;code&gt;df2&lt;/code&gt;. This ensures that we are always aware about all DataFrames that point to
the same memory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can now ask the reference tracking object how many Blocks pointing to the same NumPy array
are alive. The reference tracking object evaluates the weak references and tells us that more
than one object references the same data. This enables us to trigger a copy internally if one of 
them is modified inplace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-python"&gt;df2.iloc[0, 0] = 100
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Block in &lt;code&gt;df2&lt;/code&gt; is copied through a deep copy, creating a new Block that has its own data and
reference tracking object. The original block that was backing &lt;code&gt;df2&lt;/code&gt; can now be garbage collected,
which ensures that the arrays backing &lt;code&gt;df&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;df2&lt;/code&gt; don't share any memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="../images/deep_dive_cow/copy-on-write_copy.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look at a different scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-python"&gt;df = None
df2.iloc[0, 0] = 100
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;df&lt;/code&gt; is invalidated before we modify &lt;code&gt;df2&lt;/code&gt;. Consequently, the weakref of our reference tracking
object, that points to the Block that backed &lt;code&gt;df&lt;/code&gt;, evaluates to &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;. This enables us to modify 
&lt;code&gt;df2&lt;/code&gt; without triggering a copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="../images/deep_dive_cow/copy-on-write_invalidate.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our reference tracking object points to only one DataFrame which enables us to do the operation
inplace without triggering a copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;reset_index&lt;/code&gt; above creates a view. The mechanism is a bit simpler if we have an operation that 
triggers a copy internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-python"&gt;df2 = df.copy()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This immediately instantiates a new reference tracking object for our DataFrame &lt;code&gt;df2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="../images/deep_dive_cow/copy-on-write_copy_immediately.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have investigated how the Copy-on-Write tracking mechanism works and when we trigger a copy. 
The mechanism defers copies in pandas as much as possible, which is quite different from the non-CoW 
behavior. The reference tracking mechanism keeps track of all DataFrames that share memory,
enabling more consistent behavior in pandas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next part in this series will explain techniques that are used to make this mechanism more
efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
